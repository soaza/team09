-- Q24 --
-- add_session: This routine is used to add a new session to a course offering.
-- The inputs to the routine include the following: course offering identifier, new session number, new session day,
-- new session start hour, instructor identifier for new session, and room identifier for new session.
-- If the course offeringâ€™s registration deadline has not passed and the the addition request is valid,
-- the routine will process the request with the necessary updates.

-- course offering identifier: do we want to add a field to the schema?
-- or just use launch date and cid, bc for q10 they said course offering identifier but have launch date also
-- Need to consider things like, whether the room is being used on another day
