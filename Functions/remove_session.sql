```
23.remove_session: 
This routine is used to remove a course session. 
Inputs : course offering identifier and session number.

If the course session has not yet started and the request is valid, the routine will process the request with the 
necessary updates. The request must not be performed if there is at least one registration for the session.

Note that the resultant seating capacity of the course offering could fall below the course offeringâ€™s target number of 
registrations, which is allowed.
```
-- NOTE: course offering identifier consists of launch date and course id as Offerings is a weak entity of Courses
-- TODO: What do they mean by valid?
